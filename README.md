# FRIEND INVADERS!!!

## About

Everyone likes to have fun.  Shooting things is fun.  Shooting your friends is even more fun!

Friend Invaders is a one-page-app game.  The usual attacking aliens in a space shoot-em-up game are replaced by 
pictures of the user's facebook friends' faces.  The user's face moves back and forth on the bottom of the screen shooting up at the friend invaders.  The first version of this game will be optimized for use in a browser on a desktop or laptop, but may work for higher-speed mobile devices as well. 

The About section will feature Keith Reynolds in a youtube video singing and playing the Friend Invaders theme song.

The Hall of Champions will display the top scores and players in a star wars type fashion.

The main action will take place in an HTML5 canvas manipulated with Javascript.

A user with a keyboard will be only using three keys: left, right, and spacebar(shoot).

A user without a keyboard will be able to touch on screen buttons representing left right and spacebar(shoot).
